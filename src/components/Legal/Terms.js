attempt to resolve disputes in good faith. If unresolved, the Parties agree to
engage a mediator to attempt to resolve the dispute. The costs of the

equitable relief from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.

standard post or email. Notice is deemed served 48 hours after posting or

a Force Majeure Event, as long as the Party notified the other Party as soon
as reasonably practicable in writing about the Force Majeure Event and has
made reasonable efforts to minimize the impact.
<br/>
(d)<strong>Feedback and complaints:</strong>  We are always looking to improve our
services. If you have any feedback or a complaint, please contact us and we

Jurisdiction], and both parties submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
